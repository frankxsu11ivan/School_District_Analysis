# School_District_Analysis

## 1. Overview of Project
	The overview of the project is a written school district analysis. 
	Education dollars are tied to testing of math and reading. 
	the job is handed over to a new analysist. the analysist reworks data into data frames and series to complete the output.

### Purpose
	the purpose of Mod 4 is introduction to panda dependencies, data frames and series. 
	the purpose is to introduce series or one dimensional lists that are capable of holding any data type, and manipulate the lists.
	additionally the purpose of Mod 4 is to introduce data frames - which are able to hold multiple panda series.

## 2. Analysis and Challenges
	The analysis is sparsing education data (Series) and data frames to understand and tell an education finace story.
	As part of the challenge panadas library are imported as a dependency == pd. these libraries then tell the story for educational finances
 	
	Challenge of Mod 4 are new applications to run the analysis. 
	The challenge begame evident to me as more time was spent loading environments and apps than working on code.

## Analysis of outcomes based on tests
	A deeper dive into the data is needed. 
	As the module progressed, data was focused on Thomas High school. analysis according to math and reading percentages were run, removing the 9th grade. The data is skewed to the narritive the finacial manager (Maria) wanted to tell. 
	The excersize continued with high scores and low scores can be seen through the correlation of the same median education price per student and higher score results in charter schools...
	the district summary removing data is not comprehensive and complete. the data removed of Thomas high school questions all data.  
	directly finacial analysis - simular price per student and district test scores are under achieving. the deeper dive is why.?
		#data frame results address the following:
			*district summary = 15 schools, 39,170 students, average math score 9 above passing, average reading score 11 above passing.
			*school summary = district schools spnd an equal amount on their students for lower test scores.
			*replacing 9th grade data = bumped up the percentage.
		#replacing 9th grade scores affect the following:
			*Scores by spending = by keeping the budget size constant
			*Scores by Size =  keep the score by size in the district (#the low score) constant
			*Scores by school size =  keep the score by school size in the district constant
			*Scores by school type = keep the spread between district and chater schools constant
## 3. The Four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas high had been repalced with NaNs did not change the overall. 
The lowest preforming schools are the large district schools. 
While focus on Thomas high School 9th grade was part of the excersize - it does not impact high preformace of charter schools nor total school budget.
Direct response - replaceing NANs in the scores became noise.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	challenges and difficulties encountered during module 4 is getting the apps to work.
